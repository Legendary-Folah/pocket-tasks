How to Run the App

- Load your emulator or connect to a physical device to run your app using flutter run.

State Management

Architecture
- Tried using the clean architecture which is best to use feature based but this is a project with no much details so we grouped constants like colors in a file, we grouped all screens made in a screen folder while all common widgets in the widget folder.
